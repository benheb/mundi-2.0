# Open Data: The Next Generation

*The purposes of this project is to create a working prototype of what Open Data TNG might look like. The end product should demonstrate the workflows and capabilities without fine-tuning the details.*

**Goal:** To design open data around the individual and immediately put the data to work. 

There will be five pages: a **homepage** with four tabs across the top; **catalog**, **developers**, **help**, and **contact**. These five pages are outlined in issues in this repo and open for comment and iterations during the week 9/8/2015.
