# Open Data: The Next Generation

*The purposes of this project is to create a working prototype of what Open Data TNG might look like. The end product should demonstrate the workflows and capabilities without fine-tuning the details.*

**Goal:** To design open data around the individual and immediately put the data to work. 

There will be six pages: a [**homepage**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/1); **dashboard**, **data narratives**, [**my data**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/8), [**developers**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/3), [**help**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/4), and [**contact**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/5). These pages are outlined in issues in this repo and open for comment and iterations.

The homepage remains as we know it to be - search function, dataset categories that lead to search results, whatever the organization wants to showcase. 

There is a new page that administrators can add: a dashboard. This dashboard will have "blocks" for datasets -- they can be stats (for key performance indicators), charts, map views. Clicking on a dataset will take the user to that dataset's narrative ((example)[https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/en/stat/goals/mei7-q2k3/u8rv-dkj4/3v8e-jpxe]). 

The narrative page would include more charts and a map of the data, along with text and pictures, if wanted. Users could interact with the charts and the maps to display different attributes, and could share the views.
