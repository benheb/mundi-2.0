# Open Data: The Next Generation

*The purposes of this project is to create a working prototype of what Open Data TNG might look like. The end product should demonstrate the workflows and capabilities without fine-tuning the details.*

**Goal:** To design open data around the individual and immediately put the data to work. 

There will be six pages: a [**homepage**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/1) with five tabs across the top; [**catalog**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/2), [**my data**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/8), [**developers**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/3), [**help**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/4), and [**contact**](https://github.com/ArcGIS/opendata-tng/issues/5). These five pages are outlined in issues in this repo and open for comment and iterations during the week 9/8/2015.
